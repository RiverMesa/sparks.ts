Hi! This is the help info for Sparks, the indie TRPG Discord bot.

Sparks' dice-rolling commands are all subcommands of `/roll`. For example, `/roll sbr fallout` rolls a Sparked by Resistance fallout test. The full list of commands is as follows:

- `/roll sbr check`: rolls a Sparked by Resistance check. Requires the number of d10s to toll.
- `/roll sbr fallout`: rolls a Sparked by Resistance fallout test.
- `/roll forged`: rolls a Forged in the Dark roll. Requires both the number of d6s to roll and the type of roll. Unlike SbR games, FitD games only ever use d6s, so it made more sense to integrate them into a single command.
- `/buzz`: Sparks will reply with "Zap!"
- `/flicker`: Sparks will reply with "Hummmmmmmmmm...", like the sound of a flickering fluorescent light.
