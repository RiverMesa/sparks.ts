**NOTE:** If developing in VSCode (which is what I did), you will probably need to install the [Yarn SDKs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks)! You can do so with `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode` once you've `yarn install`ed all the dev dependencies. Doing this will make sure Prettier, ESLint, and Typescript all play nicely with each other.
